# OpenapiClient::PatchBusinessRequest

## Properties

| Name | Type | Description | Notes |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- | ----- |
| **business_name** | **String** | I am curious to see if this works with markdown like this link: [to google](https://www.google.com) | [optional] |

## Example

```ruby
require 'openapi_client'

instance = OpenapiClient::PatchBusinessRequest.new(
  business_name: null
)
```
